Reflections from Lesson 1

1. Viewing the comparison between 2 files was quite easier
with version control since only the differences are shown
without the need to manually check all data in both files.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because it highlights all variances and helps identify 
bugs easily and efficiently, allowing for focus on more 
important tasks.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having 
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?


4. Why do you think some version control systems, like 
Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Perhaps in order to facilitate complex analysis that 
includes comparing and controlling data in its entirety.

5.How can you use the commands git log and git diff to 
view the history of files?

This allows highlighting the differences between 2 files 
and showing all the history of changes.

6.How might using version control make you more 
confident to make changes that could break something?

Version control will allow finding the correct prior 
version and restoring it.

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what 
do you want to try using Git for?

To facilitate managing my projects and better / 
quicker application development.

Pros of manual creation of Git - one can choose only 
is deemed necessary in order to reduce storage costs.
Having versions automatically saved increases the 
availability of historical versions.Increases storage.
