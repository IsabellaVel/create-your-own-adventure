Reflections from Lesson 2

1. What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?
This way we create a new repository with its 
metadata in .files. This is necessary in order to 
track the commits and udpates to the tracked files.

2. How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area includes files to commit.
The repository contains all commits.
The staging area shows files to be committed,
which will then go to the repository.
